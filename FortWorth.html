<p>The population of Fort Worth is 956,709. This population is pretty standard for the area that it is in. You have to take what's around it. The whole area in itself really always gets called DFW because al the surrounding area around it kind of blends into on another.</p>
<p>Fort Worth was incorporated into Texas in the year 1873. the history of this town is pretty simple. It started out as an outpost for the army at the time known as camp Worth. The name came from the general at the time William Jenkins Worth, leader in the war in 1812 and the Mexican American war. After he died it was later named to Fort Worth in 1849 and the purpose of this post was to defend settlement raids by Native Americans. </p>
<P>Fort Worth is located in Tarrant county but in specific to the region in Texas it is in north-central Texas. This city constitutes the left port or western portion of the DFW area and is locally known as the metroplex.</P>
<p>The city of Fort Worth has a suburban feel, but it's also apart of the DFW urban area known as the metroplex. so the pin it exactly is tough but overall I would call it a suburban city.</p>
<p>The average income for this city is $72,000 a year. This is slightly lower than most of the area around it, but still competes with local cities. In comparison to the rest of the state though this city is blown out of the water by about 20-30 thousand dollars. </p>

<aside>A fun Fact about Fort Worth is that this city has a live stock yard where you can go and see live cattle. The Stock yards also do a twice daily cattle drive that citizens can watch and see. One more fun fact about the Stock yards is that Bonnie and Clyde actually used this place as a hideout.</aside>
