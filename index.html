            <h2>Some info about the State of Texas</h2>
            <p>The state of Texas is a great state to live in. It has beautiful grasslands and tons of agricultural opportunities.</p>
            <p>The state of Texas has a great flower as well. That flower being the Bluebonnet.</p>
            <p>Texas is also the second largest state in the United States. It covers about 268,5696 square miles.</p>
            <p>Texas' major cities include: Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and Fort worth. There are other "major" hubs in Texas, but these are most commonly known to outsiders.</p>
            <img class="moveRight" src="download (1).png" alt="State of Texas symbol" width="250">
            <p>As stated before Texas has many opportunities. More of those opportunities are Energy, especially oil and gas, Technology, with Austin being the biggest reason for this, Agriculture, and manufacturing.</p>
            <p>Overall, Texas is a great place to either visit or live. Here are my top 3 reasons one would come to this state:
                <ol>
                    <li>Career growth. As stated before the tech and agriculture fields in this state provide great opportunity</li>
                    <li>Diverse Culture. There are many different cities in this state that provide all types of different cultures</li>
                    <li>Cost of living. Now this one varies between city to city, but overall I would say Texas is one of the most affordable states to live in.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Here is also a table to provide just a little more information on what the populations look like between the "Major Hubs" here in Texas:</p>
