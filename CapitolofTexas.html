<h2>Some info about Austin(The capitol of Texas)</h2>

<p>Austin was incorporated into Texas in the year 1839. The backstory on this is that the independent Republic of Texas chose a tiny village, formerly called Waterloo located near the Colorado river at the time. This was later renamed to Austin because of Stephen F. Austin.</p>

When I say sprawling I mean rapid development at that. The most luxurious ones though, are the ones that reside on the river front. </p>
