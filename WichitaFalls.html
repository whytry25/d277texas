    <p>The population of Wichita Falls is 102,664. This number is quite low compared to the other cities in this project, but most popularly known for its rich freight industry.</p>
    <p>The city was officially incorporated into the state in 1889 and has its first city meeting on August 21, with mayor Otis T.Bacon.</p>
    <p>The region of this city is north Texas, and when I say north I mean almost on the border of Oklahoma and Texas. In fact, this city is only 20 minutes away from the border of Oklahoma only being separated by the even smaller city of Burkburnett.</p>
    <p>the city of Wichita falls much like DFW is a hard one to pin when it comes to the suburban or other category, except in this case its not between suburban and urban, but suburban and rural. Much of this city is suburban but any direction you go for maybe 15 20 minutes takes you into heavy rural areas. I'm talking like dirt roads and that such. Overall though, you would most closely pin it too suburban.</p>
    <p>The average individual income for this city is significantly lower than the rest of the cities in this project being on around 30k and the household income being 55k. Again take into account that the state average is around 100k for the household in Texas, but you also have to remember that this town is a lot smaller with smaller opportunities so the wages are no where close to a city like Austin where the lowest paying job is probably around $19 an hour.</p>

<aside>A fun fact about the city of Wichita Falls is that Midwestern State University actually is the main college here, which in itself isn't a crazy fact because most cities have colleges, but that Dr. Phil the TV personality actually went to this college.</aside>
